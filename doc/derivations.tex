\begin{document}
The story deflections are given by equation 12.8-15 as:
$$\delta_x = \frac{C_d \delta_{xe}}{I_e}$$
Where $\delta_{xe}$ is the calculated elastic deflection. This is taken to be:
$$\delta_{xe} = \frac{F_x}{K_x}$$
Where $F_x$ is the design story shear (\S 12.8.3) and $K_x$ is the story stiffness.
The story drift is the difference between story deflections:
$$\Delta_x = \delta_x - \delta_{x-1}$$
Equations 1 and 2 can substituted into this to get:
$$\Delta_x = \frac{C_d}{I_e} \left(\frac{F_x}{K_x} - \frac{F_{x-1}}{K_{x-1}}\right)$$
$K_x$ is then solved for:
$$K_x = \frac{F_x}{\frac{\Delta_x I_e}{C_d} + \frac{F_{x-1}}{K_{x-1}}}$$
